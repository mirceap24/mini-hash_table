# Hash Table Project

## Overview

This project implements a hash table in C with support for dynamic resizing, collision handling using double hashing, and proper management of deleted items. The hash table provides efficient insertion, search, and deletion operations.

## Features

- **Dynamic Resizing**: The hash table resizes itself to maintain efficient load factors.
- **Collision Handling**: Uses double hashing to resolve collisions.
- **Deleted Item Management**: Properly handles deleted items to maintain performance.

## Files

- `hash_table.h`: Header file containing the structure definitions and function prototypes.
- `hash_table.c`: Implementation file containing the functions for the hash table operations.
